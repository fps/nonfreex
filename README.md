# nonfreex

Nonfree software packaged for a distribution that sounds like "geeks". We'll use "geeks" as a placeholder for the other project's name.

# How to use it? 

Add the root of the checkout to your GUILE_PATH or whatever makes that schemey package manager of that other distro happy and use

<pre>
geeks
</pre>

like you would with any package shipped with <code>Geeks</code>
